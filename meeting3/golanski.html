    <h1>Yann Golanski abstract</h1>

<p>

The Internet infrastructure can be broken down into inter-connected
zones of administrative control known as autonomous systems (AS). An AS
has total control over the routing policies within its network.  Each AS
determines where to forward packets according to its internal policies
and information it can gain from its neighbours about the state of the
network as a whole.  Network instability happen when an AS switches its
best route rapidly.  This can lead from delays to whole portions of the
Internet becoming unreachable.</p>
  
<p>
This talk will be about modelling Interdomain Routing with game theory.
While game theory has been used in the context of Internet research, it
is mainly used where the players are users of the network.  Here, it is
network nodes themselves that are the players.  Using game theoretic
ideas, it maybe possible to come up with a set of winning strategies for
ASes to avoid creating instabilities or at least to minimise their
impact.</p>

<p>In simple routing games, each player (network node) tries to route
packets according to its preferred route with full knowledge of the
network topology.  To model Interdomain routing realistically, the game
becomes Bayesian in nature where each player has some a priory notion of
what other may do.  Some simple examples of both games will be given.</p>

<p>This is a work in progress and comments are welcome.</p>
