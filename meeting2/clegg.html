    <h1>Mathematics of Networks (Clegg Abstract)</h1>
<p>
Long-range dependence (a statistical phenomenon related to the autocorrelation function)
in the internet is a subject which has had a lot of research 
interest over the last ten years.  In the literature, four causal mechanisms are suggested:
<ul>
<li /> Data traffic may be generated in a way which is LRD as it leaves the computer (e.g. VBR video
traffic).
<li /> LRD may arise from the heavy tail of the sizes of transferred files.
<li /> LRD may arise from feedback mechanisms in the TCP protocol.
<li /> LRD may arise from the topology of the network itself.
</ul>
</p>
<p>This talk attempts to explain the four mechanisms and provide some insight into which are genuinely of
importance.
