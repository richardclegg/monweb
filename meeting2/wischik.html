    <h1>Mathematics of Networks (Wischik Abstract)</h1>
<p>
Traffic flows with long-range dependence satisfy a certain type of scaling
relationship, and it is this scaling relationship which governs the
scaling behaviour of a queueing network fed by such flows. In this paper
we present a mathematical technique for reasoning about scaling behaviour
in queueing systems, based on large deviations theory. Our technique makes
it straightforward to calculate the impact of long-range dependent traffic
on tandem queues, priority queues, and many other systems.
