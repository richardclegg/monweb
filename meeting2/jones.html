    <h1>Mathematics of Networks (Jones Abstract)</h1>
<p>
By considering nested crossings made by a continuous process, we build a
tree of crossings that encodes the sample path. From the crossing tree
we obtain a test for self-similarity and an estimator for the Hurst
index H of a self-similar process. </p>
<p>
The estimator, combined with the self-similarity test, is employed to
detect and quantify self-similarity in network packet traffic. We also
investigate non-stationarity phenomena in network traffic, with respect
to time variation of H.
