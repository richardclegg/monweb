    <h1>Mathematics of Networks (Smith Abstract)</h1>
<p> I have been doing some work on networks with "variable" demand and maybe
some of that might be of interest in telecoms network modelling. One of the
models used in transportation modelling is a kind of gravity model (the
doubly constrained gravity model). This allows demand for certain
source-sink pairs to grow because the deterrence is small for those pairs.
</p><p>
I would describe that (and other demand models), and the often currently
assumed "equilibrium" interaction between supply and demand for transport,
as something that might be relevant to telecoms. I would also consider the
problem of using controls optimally in the face of a variable demand model.
