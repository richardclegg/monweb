== Olaf Maennel (Loughborough) - 10 Lessons from 10 Years of Measuring and Modeling the Internetâ€™s  Autonomous Systems

Formally, the Internet inter-domain routing system
is a collection of networks, their policies, peering relationships
and organizational affiliations, and the addresses they advertize.
It also includes components like Internet exchange points. By its
very definition, each and every aspect of this system is impacted
by BGP, the de-facto standard inter-domain routing protocol.
The element of this inter-domain routing system that has
attracted the single-most attention within the research 
community has been the "inter-domain topology". Unfortunately, almost
from the get go, the vast majority of studies of this topology,
from definition, to measurement, to modeling and analysis, have
ignored the central role of BGP in this problem. The legacy is a
set of specious findings, unsubstantiated claims, and ill-conceived
ideas about the Internet as a whole.
By presenting a BGP-focused state-of-the-art treatment of the
aspects that are critical for a rigorous study of this inter-domain
topology, we demystify in this paper many "controversial"
observations reported in the existing literature. At the same
time, we illustrate the benefits and richness of new scientific
approaches to measuring, modeling, and analyzing the inter-domain 
topology that are faithful to the BGP-specific nature of
this problem domain.
