   <h1>Jeff Johnson -- Abstract</h1>
<h3>Hypernetworks and multilevel dynamics in complex systems</h3>
<p>
Graphs and networks have proved a powerful means of analysing binary
relations between pairs of things. This talk will show how they can be
extended naturally to the general case of n-ary relations between n
things. Hypergraphs provide a set-theoretic generalisation of graphs but
they are not rich enough. What I will call the 'hypernetwork',  provides a
much more powerful means of modelling relations and relations between
relations. Based on simplicial complexes, hyperworks have a
multidimensional generalisation of the connectivity of graphs and
networks. Like hypergraphs they have a Galois lattice connectivity
structure, and this is fundamental to the  dynamics of systems. It  will be
shown that n-ary relations lead naturally to multilevel structure, and
hypernetworks form a natural backcloth for the dynamic traffic of
intra-level and inter-level system activity. Furthermore, hypernetworks
have their own dynamics leading to a discrete view of system time. It  will
be argued that these structures are necessary if not sufficient for
understanding the multilevel dynamics of complex systems. The talk  will be
developed through examples.
