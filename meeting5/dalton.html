   <h1>Nick Dalton -- Abstract</h1>
<h3>Spatial networks - localization of structure</h3>
<p>
This talk will look at some of the network theories developed in architecture under the name of 'Space Syntax'. Core to the development of these theories was the process of mapping/visualizing of total path length for all nodes in a graph. Space syntax contends that there are strong correlations between the patterns of social space use ( pedestrian movement/crime/retail/research) and the configurational properties of physical-space revealed via the visualization.
</p>

<p>
To further research in large scale systems it was necessary to introduce the concept of restricted radius total path length and therefore create the process of relativisation. The mathematics of this process where defined in the 'Social logic of Space' by Hillier and Hanson in 1989. The talk with introduce this relativisation process and end by showing some of the applications of this network theory in real social contexts.</p>
