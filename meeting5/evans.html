   <h1>Tim Evans -- Abstract</h1>
<h3>Scale free networks from self-organisation</h3>
<p>
I will show how a mechanism using random walks gives a scale-free network.
Further any variation of the method will still lead to various scale-free
networks.  I will also comment on the use of random walks in other network
problems.  The work is based in part on <a href="http://uk.arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0405123">PRE 72 (2005) 1  cond-mat/040b12</a>
