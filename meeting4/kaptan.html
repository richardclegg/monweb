   <h1>Varol Kaptan -- Abstract</h1>
<h3>The random neural network model and some of
its applications</h3>
<p>
The Random Neural Network (RNN) is a biologically inspired neural
network model proposed by Prof. Gelenbe in which signals are 
represented as discrete spikes. I will start by describing certain 
properties of neuronal signalling in real biological neurons and how 
these have inspired the RNN model. Next, I will introduce the mathematics 
of RNN and will provide selected examples of RNN applications. These are 
modelling of biological neural systems, texture recognition and 
segmentation, image and video compression and multicast routing.</p>
