    <h1>Keith Briggs -- Abstract</h1>
<h3>Exponential Random Graphs</h3>
<p>
Ensembles of graphs formed in close analogy to statistical mechanical
models in physics have recently become popular again after being first proposed 
(as p* models) by social networkers in the 1960s.   They seem to provide a way
of unifying various loosely-defined models often used in network applications
(scale-free graphs etc.) into a single rigorous framework.  I will give an introduction
to this theory and discuss possible developments (exactly soluble models, perturbation theory, MCMC methods for simulation, parameter estimation) and application areas.
