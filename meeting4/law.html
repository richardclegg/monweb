<h3>Ecological Networks</h3>
<p>
There is a suggestion that ecological networks of interacting species are
unusual in that they lack some of the small-world properties of other
kinds of network.  This talk examines some processes that might make
ecological networks special.  First, ecological networks have dynamics
that stem from the birth and death of individuals: it is only those
networks with dynamics that allow their continued existence that we
actually see.  Second, the networks do not arise fully made: they are
constructed by the sequential arrival of species and the reorganisation of
links that follows from this.  Third, evolution of the species that make
up the nodes takes place due to the forces of natural selection caused by
the interactions, and the presence of genetic variation.  Such processes
are special features of networks of living organisms and would be expected
to affect the properties they have.
