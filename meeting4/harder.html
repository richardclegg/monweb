<h3>Observations with a Small Network Telescope</h3>
<p>
In this talk I will report on observations made with a network telescope
between 28 January 2005 and 5 March 2005 (Period 1) and 24 March 2005
and 13 May 2005 (Period 2). The telescope in use is a
class C network. We analyse the incoming traffic and investigate its
statistical properties. The incoming traffic shows that only a few IP
sources and destination ports are responsible for the majority of the
traffic. We also demonstrate various ways to visualise the observed
traffic to identify portscans, hostscans and distributed denial of
service attacks. Looking at the inter arrival time of packets, the
power spectrum and the detrended fluctuation analysis of the
observed traffic, we show that there is very little sign of long
range dependence. This is in stark contrast to other network
traffic.
