* 1) Daniel Maxwell (no affiliation given)
"Every child can be a rocket scientist - how connected computation can make it happen"

Off theme, waffly... 
DEFINITE REJECT

* 2) Athen Ma (Queen Mary, University of London)
"Can a not-the-most-connected scientist still be important?"

On theme, looks rigorous.  Ideal for us.
DEFINITE ACCEPT

* 3) Ruben Sanchez-Garcia (Southampton)
"Hierarchical spectral clustering of power grids"

Not much detail provided.  Off theme but appears interesting work.
Hard to judge from what we have.

ACCEPT IF ROOM

* 4) Tom Brughmans (Southampton)
"Exploring visibility networks in Iron Age and Roman Southern Spain with Exponential Random Graph Models"
Arguably on theme (just).  Interesting new theme for MoN.  Not sure 
what the mathematical basis is other than ERGM.

ACCEPT IF ROOM

* 5) David Saad (Aston) 
"Polymer physics for route optimisation on the London underground"
Off theme.  Extremely interesting work to me.  Looks to have some new techniques.

DEFINITE ACCEPT

* 6) Andrew Elliott (Oxford)
"A novel null model to test the significance of features of sampled networks."
Off theme but a potentially interesting subject.  Looks like sound work.

ACCEPT IF ROOM

* 7) Steve Gilmour (Southampton)
"Optimal design of experiments on social networks"
On theme, related to Ben's work which I know is interesting but not too many
details provided

DEFINITE ACCEPT

8) Danicia Greetham (Reading)
"On Twitter conversations"
On theme but not too many details provided.

ACCEPT ONLY IF ROOM

* 9) Antonio Lima (Birmingham)
"The Anatomy of a Scientific Rumor"
On theme and potentially interesting.  Scant on detail but enough to make me very interested.

DEFINITE ACCEPT

* 10) Mark Herbster (UCL)
"Similarity Prediction of Networked Data"
Off theme but I am really interested in seeing this.  Looks like sound work.

ACCEPT IF ROOM

11) Abraham Narh (Newcastle)
"An Identification of the Dynamical States of Road Traffic in Signalised Urban Networks based on Chaos Theory"
Off theme.  Looks to be just using state space reconstruction on road data but
perhaps it is doing more.  Not sure there is a "Networks" aspect.

PROBABLY REJECT
