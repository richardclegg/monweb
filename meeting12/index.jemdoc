== About Mathematics of Networks 

Mathematics of Networks is an informal 
[../ series of meetings] which encourages
interdisciplinary communication in networking research.  It is an
excellent venue for presenting new ideas or gaining a wider audience
for established research.  Presentations on any aspect of networking are
welcomed, particularly if the techniques or conclusions are applicable
in other networking disciplines.  Slides and information from previous
meetings [../ are available].

To receive updates on this meeting or to hear about future meetings 
in the series, please join the
