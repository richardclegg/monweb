Title: On the master route problem

Abstract:
Assume that a company has a set of customers to which it delivers products 
on a regular basis. Each day, however, the list of customers to be served 
is only a proper subset of the set of all customers. The company would 
like to design a master route to serve all customers.  A route is called a 
master route, if (i) it is an optimal route, and (ii) the ordering of 
customers remains optimal even after deleting any subset of the customers. 
Some time ago we gave a complete characterization of cases when the 
problem can be solved efficiently. In our talk we discuss the structure of 
networks for which the master route problem can be solved efficiently.
