I wish to talk on "Nonlinear vibration of a happiness model with commensurate fractional-order derivative".  Abstract:
The nonlinear vibration of a happiness model with commensurate fractional-order derivative is studied analytically and ascertained by numerical ones. At first the boundary between oscillatory and non-oscillatory parametric regions and asymptotic dynamics of autonomous model in vibration region are predicted and illustrated by harmonic balance method, and it is found that when the past experiences of a person have much influence on his/her present and future life, the model response can generate periodic vibration. Then, the influences of the impact factor of memory (IFM) on curves of the external frequency, excitation amplitude and nonlinear damping coefficient versus maximal amplitude of the emotional response to external events are presented and compared. The result shows that when the past experiences have more and more influence on his/her present and future life, the vibration amplitude of the emotional response to external events becomes bigger and bigger under same external events and non-autonomous model system presents some strong nonlinear phenomena such as multiple solutions, bifurcation and peak amplitude with the increasing of IMF. Finally, we can find that all the obtained stable solution branches match well with numerical ones.
