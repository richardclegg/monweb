= Mathematics of Networks Meetings

This informal series of meetings gives researchers a forum to present 
new work which uses mathematics to investigate networks. The meetings 
encourage interdisciplinary communications and talks have been 
from many fields including computer networks, road networks, economic 
networks, archaelogical networks and biological networks.

If you would like to attend or present at a meeting or be added to the 
list of contactees then please email [richard@richardclegg.org] or
