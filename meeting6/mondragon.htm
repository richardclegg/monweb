   <h1>Raul Mondragon  -- Abstract</h1>
<h3>Optimal networks, congestion and Braess' paradox</h3>
<p>
Networks that are efficient and robust to failures tend to have
either star-like or homogeneous structures in their connectivity. The
choice of optimal connectivity depends on the network's load.  For
high loads, the optimal network connectivity is similar to the
connectivity obtained in entangled networks (synchronisation) and
robust networks (regular graphs).
We examine if these optimal networks have other
dynamical and connectivity properties that are relevant in complex
networks, in particular in communication networks.
