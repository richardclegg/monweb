<h3>Lyapunov convergence for Lagrangian models of network control</h3>
<p>
A strong and growing theme in the design and analysis of network control
systems is to state the control objectives in terms of optimisation
theory, and then to present the network dynamics (or protocol behaviour)
as a process that seeks a solution of this optimisation problem.
Flow control algorithms, including TCP, have been extensively analysed
through various utility maximisation problems, as has power control in
mobile radio systems.
</p>
<p>
We present a stability result for a class of dynamic processes that find
the saddle point of a Lagrangian, including Lagrangians derived from
optimisation problems. Our formulation is symmetric in primal and dual
variables, and automatically derives a Lyapunov function from the form
of the dynamic equations. We show how several stability results from the
literature of distributed flow control in networks fit into this formalism.
