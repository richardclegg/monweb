<h3>Two-layer network design by discrete optimization</h3>
<p>
The integrated design of telecommunication networks with multiple
layers, representing different technologies like IP, SDH and WDM, has
become a topic of high interest in recent years, due to the potential
savings compared to single-layer network design. In this talk, we study
a two-layer network design problem with the possiblities to install logical
links at different bitrates. We formulate the problem as an integer
linear program and develop a branch-and-cut approach. For this, we
translate cutting planes for the single layer network design problem to
our setting, in particular, cut-set inequalities and general
flow-cut-set inequalities. Computational experiments show the good
performance of these cutting planes in the multi-layer setting and
emphasize the differences with single layer network design.
This is a joint work with Sebastian Orlowski, Christian Raack (both Zuse
Institute Berlin), Thomas Engel, and Georg Baier (Nokia Siemens
Networks, Munich).
