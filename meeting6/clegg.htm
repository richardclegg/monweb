   <h1>Richard Clegg -- Abstract</h1>
<h3>Markov modelling for queues of internet traffic</h3>
<p>
This talk discusses the use of Markov-modulated processes as queueing
models for internet traffic.  There have been several papers over the
last few years which describe Markov-modulated processes to capture the
long-range dependence inherent in internet traffic.  Several processes
are tested and their performance is compared with real internet data.
The conclusion is that capturing the mean and Hurst parameter of
a process is certainly not adequate to capture the queuing performance.
Systems with the same mean and Hurst parameter can perform very
differently.  This work builds upon that reported in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0610135">this paper</a>.
