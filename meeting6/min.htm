<h3>Performance Modelling of A Hybrid Scheduling Scheme under
Self-Similar Network Traffic
</h3>
<p>Traffic self-similarity (i.e., noticeable burstiness over multiple time scales) has
been discovered to be a ubiquitous phenomenon in modern communication networks and
multimedia systems. Self-similar traffic can considerably deteriorate user-perceived Quality-
of-Service (QoS) and has drawn significant interest and received tremendous research efforts
from both academia and industry. Due to its fractal-like nature, performance modelling of
self-similar traffic poses greater challenges and exhibits more complexity than that of
traditional non-bursty traffic.
</p>
<p>
The hybrid scheduling scheme that integrates the well-known Priority Queueing (PQ) and
Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) has been suggested as a promising mechanism for the
provisioning and implementation of differentiated QoS. In this talk, we will present a new
analytical model we have recently developed for the hybrid PQ-GPS scheduling scheme
subject to self-similar traffic.
</p>
<p>
In order to make the challenging performance modelling problem tractable, we propose a
novel flow-decomposition approach that can equivalently divide the PQ-GPS system into a
group of Single-Server Single-Queue (SSSQ) systems and derive their service capacities.
Based on the Large Deviation Principle and by virtue of the equivalent relationship between
these SSSQ systems and the original PQ-GPS system, we derive the queue length
distributions and loss probabilities of individual traffic flows in the hybrid system. The
validity of the proposed flow-decomposition approach and the accuracy of the analytical
model are demonstrated by comparing analytical results to those obtained through extensive
simulation experiments of theactual system.
