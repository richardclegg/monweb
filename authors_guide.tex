\maketitle

The Mathematics of Networks meeting is a series of informal meetings to 
exchange research ideas between people working in the field of networking.
While voluntary, this guide is intended to make sure that presentations 
at MoN go smoothly and are suitable for the audience.

\begin{itemize}
\item Material should not assume specialist knowledge of detailed mathematical
techniques or the particular discipline being studied.  As a guideline, your
material should be comprehensible to an able PhD student in a discipline with
reasonable mathematical content such as physics, electronic engineering or computer 
science.
\item As far as possible, the material presented should be of general interest 
to people who study networks.  
\item If you need anything for your presentation other than Powerpoint 
or PDF then please let the organisers know in advance.  You can bring your
own laptop if you so wish.
\item If possible please email a copy of your presentation to the organisers at one week
before your presentation so we can ensure the presentations display
adequately (no software incompatibilities etc) and so we can place them on the 
website before the conference.
\end{itemize}
