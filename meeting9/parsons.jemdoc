== Mark Parsons (Reading) - Social networks: evolving graphs with memory dependent edges 
 
The plethora, and mass take up, of digital communication tech- 
nologies has resulted in a wealth of interest in social network data 
collection and analysis in recent years. Within many such networks 
the interactions are transient: thus those networks evolve over time. 
In this paper we introduce a class of models for such networks using 
evolving graphs with memory dependent edges, which may appear and 
disappear according to their recent history. We consider time discrete 
and time continuous variants of the model. We consider the long 
term asymptotic behaviour as a function of parameters controlling 
the memory dependence. In particular we show that such networks 
may continue evolving forever, or else may quench and become static 
(containing immortal and/or extinct edges). This depends on the 
existence or otherwise of certain inÔ¨Ånite products and series involving 
age dependent model parameters. To test these ideas we show how 
model parameters may be calibrated based on limited samples of time 
dependent data, and we apply these concepts to three real networks: 
summary data on mobile phone use from a developing region; online 
social-business network data from China; and disaggregated mobile 
phone communications data from a reality mining experiment in the 
US. In each case we show that there is evidence for memory dependent 
dynamics, such as that embodied within the class of models proposed 
here.
