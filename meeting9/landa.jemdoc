== Raul Landa (UCL) - Economic modeling of managed overlays


Most game theoretical models of peer-to-peer overlays
focus on the incentives tensions between peers,
thus not including the ISP as an active player 
(interesting exceptions can be found in recent work
regarding ISP-content distribution and the selfish routing
literature). However, given the large amount of
bandwidth that peer-to-peer systems can
command, the ISPs have taken a much more
active role in the management of peer-to-peer, spanning
from techniques such as bandwidth capping or
throttling to cooperative approaches such as
P4P/ALTO.

Although the modelling of the incentive dynamics of
coexisting managed overlays with a single
underlying ISP is interesting in its own right, we seek
to model the preferences of overlays in the more
general setting where they can choose to allocate their
traffic matrix between a set of different ISPs. By
considering such an "unbundled ISPs" model together with
multiple competing P4P-enabled overlays, it
becomes possible to consider a much wider array of
preferences, thus achieving a more general model
for the incentives of managed overlays.
We consider that a model of managed overlay preferences
that allows ISPs to predict the traffic
matrices that an overlay will demand as a given of a
given price structure by itself and its competing
ISPs would be of great help for network dimensioning,
profit optimisation and traffic engineering.

== Biography


Raul Landa ([raul.landa@ieee.org]) is currently a 
Research Associate in the Department of Electronic and Electrical 
Engineering at University College London. After working in the 
development of network management software platforms from 2000 to 2005, 
Dr Landa joined the MASTS and PeerLive research projects in UCL. His 
research interests revolve around the application of models from 
economics and sociology to the solution of networking problems. Dr Landa 
received a B.S. in Communications Engineering by ITESM (Mexico City), 
an M.S. in Data Communications from the University of Sheffield (UK) 
and a Diploma in Information Security from UNAM (Mexico City), in 
1998, 2000 and 2004 respectively, and a PhD degree from UCL in 2010.
